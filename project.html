            <h2>1. Liability Insurance</h2>
            <p>
                Liability insurance covers damages you cause to others, including property damage and medical expenses.
                It's typically required by law in most states and ensures you can pay for damages in an accident you cause.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Collision Insurance</h2>
            <p>
                Collision insurance covers the cost of repairing or replacing your car after an accident, regardless of fault.
                Itâ€™s especially useful if you drive a valuable or newer car.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Full Coverage Insurance</h2>
            <p>
Full coverage insurance is comprised of multiple policies, and typically has liability coverage, comprehensive insurance, and collision insurance.                
The comprehensive insurance protects your car from non-collision damages such as theft, vandalism, natural disasters, or hitting an animal.
And collision insurance would help with the process of replacing the vehicle if in an accident either other people or other things like a tree.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Personal Injury Protection (PIP)</h2>
            <p>
                PIP, also known as no-fault insurance, covers medical expenses for you and your passengers after an accident,
                regardless of who is at fault. It may also cover lost wages and other related costs.
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>5. Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Coverage</h2>
            <p>
                This type of insurance protects you if you're in an accident with a driver who doesn't have insurance or enough insurance to cover your damages.
